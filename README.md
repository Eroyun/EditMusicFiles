# Group Songs By Artist Name
This app renames your file by adding the artist name to the artist section in the details of the file and removes artist name from filename, by that it allows your phones and apps such as iTunes to group songs by artist.

- 1- You must save music files like this: ```ArtistName - SongName.mp3```
>The important part is to save the file by adding  "space dash space" between the artist name and the song name. 
- 2-Before running app.py file download eyeD3 and regex! 
>In windows use py ```-m pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install required dependencies

>In Unix/MacOS use python ```-m pip install -r requirements.txt``` 

>(Or you can use the command "```pip install eyeD3```" and "```pip install re```")

- 3-Write the path of the folder containing the music files between the quotation marks in the path variable inside app.py!
- 4-You can run the app.py now!
